```

## Release Manifest Checks

From the merged release manifest:

```text
versionCode="1"
versionName="0.1.0"
uses-permission: com.shortsblockerkids.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION
uses-permission: com.android.vending.BILLING
uses-permission: android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
uses-permission: android.permission.INTERNET
service permission: android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE
```

No release manifest matches were found for:

- `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`;
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`;
- `CAMERA`;
- `RECORD_AUDIO`;
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`;
- `READ_CONTACTS`;
- `READ_SMS`.

The AccessibilityService XML does not declare `isAccessibilityTool=true`.

## Release Debug Flags

Generated release `BuildConfig`:

```text
DEBUG = false
APPLICATION_ID = "com.shortsblockerkids"
BUILD_TYPE = "release"
ACCESSIBILITY_DEBUG_TOOLS_ENABLED = false
```

## Current Release Decisions

- `versionName = 0.1.0` and `versionCode = 1` remain a controlled release
  candidate line.
- Release minification remains disabled until final release-device regression
  coverage is complete for the AccessibilityService detector path.
- Google Play Billing is integrated for the planned monthly subscription.
- The app still has no backend, analytics, ads, or account system.
- `android.permission.INTERNET` and `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
  are present through the Google Play Billing SDK; there is no custom backend or
  analytics network flow.

## Pending Before Play Internal Testing

- Create / confirm Play Console app.
- Configure Play App Signing and upload key flow.
- Upload `app-release.aab` to internal testing.
- Confirm Play Console accepts the AAB.
- Add hosted Privacy Policy URL.
- Complete Data Safety form.
- Complete Accessibility declaration.
- Upload Accessibility review demo video.
- Add store screenshots and feature graphic.
- Execute `docs/SHORTS_BLOCKER_PLAY_BILLING_INTERNAL_TEST_RUNBOOK.md` after the
  subscription product and internal testing track are active.
- Use `docs/SHORTS_BLOCKER_PLAY_CONSOLE_BILLING_CONFIG.md` for the exact
  subscription product/base-plan values.
- Run final smoke QA on the exact AAB-derived install from Play internal
  testing.
